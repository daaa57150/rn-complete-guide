### I'm following [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide) on Udemy: ###
React Native - The Practical Guide [2021 Edition] by [Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/) (great teacher).  


The course is done entirely in JS, but I'm following along in TS, adding and trying things on my own.
